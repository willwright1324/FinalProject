  <text id="0">Ahh. What a lovely day for a stroll in the park.</text>
  
  <text id="1">Hey! Give that back!</text>

  <text id="2">Maybe I can throw my cane at it by "Right Clicking"...</text>

  <text id="3">That's not right... Fooey! I've forgotten how to control myself again!</text>

  <text id="4">I should get familiar with my controls before hitting that pigeon.</text>

  <text id="5">At least I still remember that "Pressing Tab" shows my moves.</text>

  <text id="6">Uh oh. Looks like it's calling in some friends.</text>

  <text id="7">Oh boy that was tough!</text>

  <text id="8">I've remembered how to properly jump!</text>

  <text id="9">Uh oh. More baddies incoming.</text>

  <text id="10">I think I'm starting to get the hang of this!</text>

  <text id="11">I've remembered how to properly move left!</text>

  <text id="12">Uh oh. More baddies incoming.</text>

  <text id="13">Hoo hoo! All this fighting reminds me of my scrappy days!</text>

  <text id="14">I've remembered how to properly move right!</text>

  <text id="15">Uh oh. More baddies incoming.</text>

  <text id="16">These critters should start fearing ME now!</text>

  <text id="17">I've remembered how to properly attack!</text>

  <text id="18">Uh oh. More baddies incoming.</text>

  <text id="19">I'm feeling younger by the second!</text>

  <text id="20">I've remembered how to properly duck!</text>

  <text id="21">Uh oh. More baddies incoming.</text>

  <text id="22">I am unstoppable!</text>

  <text id="23">I've remembered how to properly do all of my moves!</text>

  <text id="24">There's that rascal again!</text>
  
  <text id="25">I'll hit em this time...</text>
  
  <text id="26">Hah! Scram, you! Finally, I can get my hat back.</text>
  
  <text id="27">Ahh, much better. I can head home at last...</text>
  
  <text id="28">What was that?</text>
  
  <text id="29">It looks like there's one more foe that needs roughin' up!</text>
  
  <text id="30">I can throw my cane into its mouth and kick it while it's vulnerable!</text>
  
  <text id="31">Take that scoundrel! Looks like I'll be having a feast tonight!</text>
